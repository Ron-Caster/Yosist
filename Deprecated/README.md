# Yosist
Trying to develop an AI Assistant for Windows 11.

No worries. I wanted to do something I felt lacked in my PC. Started developing it.
The basic codes I obtained from ChatGPT as a headstart to develop on.
This is 0%. You can join me if you wish. Nah I will complete it.

Just Google or ask GPT for developing the code.
End of the day we should get something

i.e; #OutputMatters not the way you did it.
